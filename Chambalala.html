        Fichee-Chambalaalla is a New Year festival celebrated among the Sidama people. According to the oral tradition,
        Fichee commemorates a Sidama woman who visited her parents and relatives once a year after her marriage, bringing
        buurisame , a meal prepared from false banana, milk and butter, which was shared with neighbours. Fichee has since
        become a unifying symbol of the Sidama people. Each year, astrologers determine the correct date for the festival,
        which is then announced to the clans. Communal events take place throughout the festival, including traditional
        songs and dances. Every member participates irrespective of age, gender and social status. On the first day,
        children go from house to house to greet their neighbours, who serve them buurisame . During the festival, clan
        leaders advise the Sidama people to work hard, respect and support the elders,b and abstain from cutting down
        indigenous trees, begging, indolence, false testimony and theft. The festival therefore enhances equity, good
        governance, social cohesion, peaceful co-existence and integration among Sidama clans and the diverse ethnic groups
        in Ethiopia. Parents transmit the tradition to their children orally and through participation in events during the
        celebration. Women in particular, transfer knowledge and skills associated with hairdressing and preparation of
        buurisame to their daughters and other girls in their respective villages.   </p>
