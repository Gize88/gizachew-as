    Foundation
    Hawassa city, formerly called A wassa, was founded near the Lake-Hawassa. It is located in between Shashamane, and
    Yirgalem town which are about 25 and 45 K.m away from the city. It is about 275 km far from Addis Ababa. Geographically,
    Hawassa city is located in between 7o5’Latitude North and 38.o28 longitude to East.The lake and the land along the edge
    of the lake have got different names in Sidama Language.The Lake has been called ‘Hawassa”, which means ‘big’ in Sidama
    language; and the land nearby it was called ‘ Ada’are ’, equivalent in meaning to the phrase “ “ “the field of cattle”.
    As it is comfortable place for rearing animals. Hence, the town established in the land adaare has got its name from the
    lake - Hawassa.The inherent attractiveness of the lake Hawassa was the major inspiring reason for the people to
    establish the town in this site. So far, the place was not occupied by residents; rather, it was used by pastoralists
    for raising their livestock. As the access of water and grasses for their cattle caught the attention of high land
    people, they used to make frequent visit to this area, and settled here. The Earliest Villages During its foundation,
    Hawassa town was classified in to four villages; namely, “Harar sefer”,”Addis Ababa Sefer”, “Korem Sefer” and “Wukiro
    sefer”. These were named so in accordance with origin of 404 commissioned soldiers camped in here coming from different
    corner of the country with the mission given by Emperor Haileselassie.
    The Emperor ordered them to replace jangle of “Adaare” by modern farm. This mission was put in to practice by support of
    Ato Mulugeta Bulli-the then Ministry of Community Development. To execute the mission, the soldiers came to Hawassa in
    two phases: the first 80 came from Addis Ababa in 1952 E.C ,and the rest from ‘Harar’,’korem’ and ‘Wukiro’ in 1953 E.C.
    Hence, the villages they occupied were named accordingly. Upgrading to Woreda Town Level Hawassa was promoted to woreda
    town by legal transference of Abela Woreda. When the conflict between Arsi Oromo and Sidama getting worse in Hawassa,
    Ras Mengesha Seyoum ordered Abela woreda officials to transfer to Hawassa, settle there, and resolve the dispute timely
    and easily. Even though Abela residents refused the transference, Emperor Haileselassie approved the proposal of Rash
    Mengesha irrespective of the appeal of Abela woreda residents. Consequently, Abela Woreda was transferred to Hawassa.
    After some times elaps, the new office and different hotelswere built in Hawassa. From hotels, Bekele Molla and
    WabiShebele No2 were a case in point. Moreover, well known individuals built their villas in the plot of land near by
    the lake. For instance, Afework Tekle, the Most Honorable, Maitre Artist, the World Laureate- build his villa near lake
    Hawassa. This gradual establishment and upgrading was made at the back side of present Telecommunication office of
    Hawassa. Welcome to Hawassa City,

    <p>
        Fichee-Chambalaalla is a New Year festival celebrated among the Sidama people. According to the oral tradition,
        Fichee commemorates a Sidama woman who visited her parents and relatives once a year after her marriage, bringing
        buurisame , a meal prepared from false banana, milk and butter, which was shared with neighbours. Fichee has since
        become a unifying symbol of the Sidama people. Each year, astrologers determine the correct date for the festival,
        which is then announced to the clans. Communal events take place throughout the festival, including traditional
        songs and dances. Every member participates irrespective of age, gender and social status. On the first day,
        children go from house to house to greet their neighbours, who serve them buurisame . During the festival, clan
        leaders advise the Sidama people to work hard, respect and support the elders,b and abstain from cutting down
        indigenous trees, begging, indolence, false testimony and theft. The festival therefore enhances equity, good
        governance, social cohesion, peaceful co-existence and integration among Sidama clans and the diverse ethnic groups
        in Ethiopia. Parents transmit the tradition to their children orally and through participation in events during the
        celebration. Women in particular, transfer knowledge and skills associated with hairdressing and preparation of
        buurisame to their daughters and other girls in their respective villages.</p>
